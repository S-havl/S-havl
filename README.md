## About Me

I'm 16 and self-taught.  
I'm not interested in flashy tools or modern frameworks. I care about understanding how things work underneath â€” operating systems, terminals, hardware.

I started with Roblox Studio (Luau), then moved into Linux, C, Python, and system-level programming.

---

## How I Learn

- I break things to understand them.
- I write down what I try and what fails.
- I care more about *how* it works than *what* it does.
- I donâ€™t rush. I go deep before moving on.

## Focus Areas

| Area                | Tools & Topics                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Operating Systems   | Linux, terminals, bootloaders          |
| Programming         | C, Python, Bash, Assembly (real mode)  |
| Networking          | TCP/IP, DNS, ports, IPs                |
| Basic Security      | Red Team, hashes, recon                |
| Automation          | Scripts, CLI tools                     |
| Version Control     | Git, GitHub                            |

## Key Repositories

- `learning-log`: terminal commands, common problems, and how I fixed them
- `scripts`: small Bash and Python tools I made while practicing
- `notes-security`: security concepts and tools Iâ€™ve tested

---

## Long-Term Goal

Right now Iâ€™m focused on learning and practicing every day.  
But I have bigger plans â€” starting with:

**Building my own operating system from scratch** â€” beginning with a terminal, then a shell, then the kernel itself.

I'm taking it one piece at a time. No shortcuts.

## Note

I'm not here to stand out.  
I'm here to understand â€” and leave behind what Iâ€™ve learned.
